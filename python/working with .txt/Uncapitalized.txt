an example of uncapitalized text is a word that is not written with capital letters or with the first letter as a capital. for instance, the word "god" can be uncapitalized, as seen in many other religions.
another example is when names are given initial capitalization when they name specific features (the rocky mountains), but remain uncapitalized when they denote a generic phenomenon (the mountains).
additionally, in some contexts, such as logins and email addresses, people's names may appear uncapitalized.
